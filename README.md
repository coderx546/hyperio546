It's been a long time since I pushed any updates right? The reason is exams. So I'll try to work on my projects but my exams are important too. This is you won't see much activity here. But, it's start of a new era. I have been thinking of making powershell scripts and electron apps. Yes apps, I will soon start making open source apps too. Electron gets a lot of hate and why should I bother making electron apps? Because of html, css and js. I know these languages already and don't want to learn (and don't have time to) new languages right now.
