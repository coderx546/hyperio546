It's been a long time since I pushed any updates right? The reason is exams. So I'll try to work on my projects but my exams are important too. This is you won't see much activity here. But, it's start of a new era. I have been thinking of making powershell scripts and elctron apps. Yes apps, I will soon start making open source apps too.
