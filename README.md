Exams are over! It's a start of a new era. I have been thinking of making powershell scripts and electron apps. Yes apps, I will soon start making open source apps too. Electron gets a lot of hate and why should I bother making electron apps? Because of html, css and js. I know these languages already and don't want to learn (and don't have time to) new languages right now. I have started learning powershell scripts.<br>
EDIT:<br>
I have the replaced my app updater script with a powershell script which can update windows too!<br>
My first electron app is up on github!
