LOL, Jokes aside, lemme tell who I am:
- I am currently in school and I sometimes code too.
- I do a lot of things over here and don't do only coding.
- I am the best at web development and I am learning Python currently.

**Silentfox is officially dead. The only reason is that I don't have enough skills nor reasources to continue it. You can look at other forks if needed. I am really sorry.**
